## Contributing

If you find this image useful here's how you can help:

- Send a pull request with your awesome features and bug fixes
- Help users resolve their [issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue).
- Support the development of this image with a [donation](http://www.damagehead.com/donate/)

## Issues

Before reporting your issue please try updating Docker to the latest version and check if it resolves the issue. Refer to the Docker [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/installation) for instructions.

SELinux users should try disabling SELinux using the command `setenforce 0` to see if it resolves the issue.

If the above recommendations do not help then [report your issue](../../issues/new) along with the following information:

- Output of the `docker version` and `docker info` commands
- The `docker run` command or `docker-compose.yml` used to start the image. Mask out the sensitive bits.
- Please state if you are using [Boot2Docker](http://www.boot2docker.io), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), etc.

# Getting started

## Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sameersbn/wowza) and is the recommended method of installation.

> **Note**: Builds are also available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/sameersbn/wowza)

```bash
docker pull sameersbn/wowza:4.1.2-8
```

Alternatively you can build the image yourself.

```bash
docker build -t sameersbn/wowza github.com/sameersbn/docker-wowza
```

## Quickstart

Before you can start using this image you need to acquire a valid license from Wowza Media Systems for the Wowza Streaming Engine software. If you do not have one, you can [request a free trial license](http://www.wowza.com/pricing/trial) or purchase a license from Wowza Media Systems.

Start Wowza using:

```bash
docker run --name wowza -d --restart=always \
  --publish 1935:1935 --publish 8086:8086 \
  --publish 8087:8087 --publish 8088:8088 \
  --env 'WOWZA_ACCEPT_LICENSE=yes' \
  --env 'WOWZA_KEY=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx' \
  --env 'WOWZA_VERSION=4.4.1' \
  --volume /srv/docker/wowza/data:/var/lib/wowza \
  --volume /srv/docker/wowza/log:/var/log/wowza \
  sameersbn/wowza:current
```

**The `--env WOWZA_ACCEPT_LICENSE=yes` parameter in the above command indicates that you agree to the Wowza EULA.**
**The `--env WOWZA_VERSION=4.4.1` parameter would cause the version in :current to be upgraded to 4.4.1. 4.4.1 is just an example and you should find the most recent version at https://www.wowza.com/pricing/installer. **

*Alternatively, you can use the sample [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file to start the container using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)*

Point your browser to http://localhost:8088 and login using the default username and password:

* username: `admin`
* password: `admin`

Refer to the wowza [quickstart guide](http://www.wowza.com/forums/content.php?3-quick-start-guide) to get started with Wowza.

## Persistence

For Wowza to preserve its state across container shutdown and startup you should mount a volume at `/var/lib/wowza`.

> *The [Quickstart](#quickstart) command already mounts a volume for persistence.*

SELinux users should update the security context of the host mountpoint so that it plays nicely with Docker:

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/docker/wowza
chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /srv/docker/wowza
```

At first run the Wowza configuration files, among other things, will be copied into this location. You can manually edit these configurations if required.

## Logs

The Wowza logs are populated in `/var/log/wowza`. You can mount a volume at this location to easily access these logs and/or perform log rotation.

Alternatively you can also use `docker exec` to tail the logs. For example,

```bash
docker exec -it wowza tail -f /var/log/wowza/wowza/wowzastreamingengine_access.log
```

# Maintenance

## Upgrading

To upgrade to newer releases:

  1. Download the updated Docker image:

  ```bash
  docker pull sameersbn/wowza:4.1.2-8
  ```

  2. Stop the currently running image:

  ```bash
  docker stop wowza
  ```

  3. Remove the stopped container

  ```bash
  docker rm -v wowza
  ```

  4. Start the updated image

  ```bash
  docker run -name wowza -d \
    [OPTIONS] \
    sameersbn/wowza:4.1.2-8
  ```

## Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell. If you are using Docker version `1.3.0` or higher you can access a running containers shell by starting `bash` using `docker exec`:

```bash
docker exec -it wowza bash
```
